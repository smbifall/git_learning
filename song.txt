[Verse 1]
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
